I don‚Äôt know. Some people are just mean. Some people use sarcasm to disregard your feelings which really bothers me. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre making fun and disregarding how you feel at the same time. Sarcasm should be funny, not hurtful.

Yup. There are A LOT more mean people than you might imagine at first glance, oftentimes because they‚Äôre waiting for an excuse (like a mistake you make or an inconvenience) to let it out.

I use sarcasm the same way you do, OP. I like other people to be in on the joke and laughing with me. It's not funny to make other people the punchline.

When people use sarcasm to be cruel and call it humor, I don't laugh or play along. I say I don't think it's funny when a joke boils down to "haha I hurt your feelings!" It's lazy and mean spirited.

I can. Only because I have seen it in tiktok and my friends and I copy it bc we thought it was funny.

For example, ‚ÄúI burnt my toast!!! EWWWW I BURNT MY TOAST‚Äù

and my friend could say ‚Äúburnt toast??? Ummmm are you okayyyyy???!!‚Äù

‚ÄúNO IM NOT OKAYYYYY!!!‚Äù

So in this example, the joke is I made a mistake, I announced the mistake, and I‚Äôm also overreacting about this mistake. My friend could say ‚Äúare you okayyyyy???‚Äù As in, I must NOT be okay to make SUCH A HUGE ERROR like burning toast. The joke is that it is not a huge error and we are overreacting. Also, it could be ‚Äúare you okay‚Äù because the burnt toast is such a tragedy that it invisibly devastated me.

However I have heard people say ‚Äúare you okay‚Äù in a MEAN RUDE way. Like, they say it in such a tone that you know they don‚Äôt care about you‚Äôre wellbeing, and they are trying to suggest something is wrong with you bc whatever you did or said is not okay (socially appropriate), so they‚Äôre asking if you‚Äôre okay because they don‚Äôt actually care and deemed you ‚Äúnot okay‚Äù in their minds already.

Sorry if this is nonsensical. I just meant I have def seen it in a fun way with my friends, but also in a mean way with not-friends.

How do you define sarcasm?

Verbal irony, or sarcasm is to say something but mean the opposite. To say something but knowing that you are not saying this literal thing based on context. This can be aided WITH tone and can also be used with hyperbole. Context, words, and tone are important. Maybe my example doesn‚Äôt translate well.

The sarcasm is pretending to overreact and using tone to indicate this. It is done ironically. To say one thing and mean the opposite. I don‚Äôt actually mean that burnt toast is a catastrophe.

The technical ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù is kind of irrelevant to its use which is probably where it trips up those autistic people that it does. To use it successfully, you need to include proper tone and be aware of your audience and their knowledge of the circumstances. It has to have a purpose of highlighting something about the circumstance as well.

Neither of your examples are sarcasm to me.

My whole family is like this, I didn't understand until I left home.

The people I see this behaviour from the most from weren't comforted as children. They were taught that have their own feelings, their own sensitivities, was a luxury - and to be accommodated to was asking too much of others. Very "pull yourself up from the bootstraps" thinking. Think the same people who brag that their parents beat them and they "turned out fine" so it's okay to hit their kids, too. They were not permitted to be children, to learn things from new - I see this the most in my sisters. They were raised as tiny adults with a fully-formed understanding of the world, and anything they didn't know or didn't understand was them just being "stupid" - so they were punished for not knowing things they were never taught. It made them cruel, it made me cruel too until I got away from it.

When your whole family functions like this, and your only experiences with people outside your family mirrors this twisted line of thinking, it's really easy to internalize that you're weak and stupid because you can't keep up. So then any time something happens that makes others see you as weak or stupid, they all have to chime in with their sarcastic non-help because that's all they know too. So the language of communicate in your family is just back-handed compliments and sarcastic digs, and dogpile anyone who expresses vulnerability, confusion, or concern.

Think the kind of people who are unable to ask simple questions out of fear of looking stupid, we're raised badly. People who decide to be wilfully ignorant because it's too "embarrassing" to be seen learning something because it signals to others that you do not know. These people speak in sarcasm to hide behind their ignorance and appear intelligent. Some people really believe that arrogance = intelligence.

Saying "I don't know" or "Can you repeat that, please" is seen as an invitation to jump down your throat about how stupid you are rather than an invitation to clarify their initial statement. Had the roles been flipped, their course of action may have been to just ignore what you said and hope it doesn't come up again - or to just pretend that they know what you mean. If they're from a fucked up family, that makes "sense" to them - it's safer.

You're not doing anything wrong, their parents were shit and now we have to suffer the consequences.

Something that helps is instead of thinking "What did I do wrong for them to treat me this way?", try framing it as "Did something happen that made this person feel insecure, vulnerable, or envious?" - because chances are, it isn't you. Don't blame yourself for their shitty behaviour.

Maybe you feeling secure enough to be open and ask for clarification made her feel envy that she doesn't feel like she is allowed to ask the same things without being attacked? Maybe the way that you conduct yourself and have grace and empathy for yourself irritates her because she desires to feel the same way, but she feels unable to.

Some of the people I grew up with who were the cruellest to me as a child and later apologized when we became adults shared this sentiment - they felt that because they were NT they were held to a higher "standard" and were envious that they couldn't catch a break like they assumed I could - not realizing that getting punished for my symptoms and segregated from the group wasn't really a privilege but hey, we were kids.

Some NT people who were raised by hard-ass parents see ND people as "spoiled", and we have to deal with the brunt of their misplaced feelings. My sisters are a good example of this.

I could be totally wrong too, maybe they're just having a bad day. This might not apply at all, but in the slim chance it does, I felt it was worth sharing - I drove myself crazy blaming myself for this shit for years before someone explained this side of it to me, so I don't want you or anyone else to feel like it's your fault when it really isn't.

"Did something happen that made this person feel insecure, vulnerable, or envious?" - because chances are, it isn't you."

Now that i'm thinking about it, they actually might've felt that way. Because i was trying to compliment her because something about her looked nice and different; but i couldn't figure out what looked different so couldn't find the words and i was just mumbling about her clothes. (after she left, i realized it was a haircut!) i can imagine that that could've made her feel self-conscious or something.

A NT person generally feels social cues more strongly. I mean that they sense social cues more like physical sensation happening to them...rather than intellectually analyzing cues for accurate info. They dont want to be SEEN being mean or too direct (being acutely-aware of how they are seen, how the people in the room feel about them, and their social status, feeling other people's feelings...leads to people pleasing/fake niceness and acting out mean feelings instead of saying them) because it opens them up to criticism. Instead of sticking their neck out (making a scene, drawing attention), they will use sarcasm to be rude because it's sneaky and other people are less likely to punish it (get upset or defend the person). Words are considered less harmful than violence, so people can get away with saying nasty things using sarcasm and not get in trouble/lose status with their friends.

I think some people do it as a kind of humour and to cheer up a situation, at least that's how I believe it should be used. Such as if you're waiting in a really long line say haha "I looove lines they're my favourite" in a sarcastic tone, it doesn't hurt anyone it's just like pretending it's opposite day or whatever.

I typically only use it right after I've seen someone else use it to fit in or at a stage where I think it'd be funny, it's never been directed at a person, only to brighten up a situation.

But if people use it in an insulting way I stay away from them. I'm not sure if they're actively trying to be mean and using sarcasm to 'soften' the meanness, I can't answer that without directly asking someone who does it like that. Likely they don't think too much about other's feelings when they're doing it.

To me sarcasm is always a negative expression. There's no real positive sarcasm. Instead people would instead us a more positive form of humor (commiseration, puns, friendly joking, etc).

Worse, sarcasm then gets weaponized as a socially-acceptable way to insult and abuse people. Its just another form of "just kidding bro." I dont let sarcastic people into my life. I find them hugely immature. Even the ones that dont lash out at others, I still find it a very negative trait that sets off my RSD sometimes, makes me worry if this person is angry or angry at me, and makes me wonder why I keep this person in my life.

I'm not saying that everyone who uses sarcasm regularly is a terrible person, but all terrible people I've met use sarcasm regularly. So there's quite a bit of overlap. I also think being a "good sarcasm user" sets off similar red flags even if you dont mean it.

I always wondered how people liked Chandler from friends. I think if he was a real person in your life youd find him toxic and unbearable after a short while.

It also really triggers my RSD. I get so worried that i've done something wrong and offended someone without meaning to. If someone regularly uses sarcasm, i can distance myself from it, cuz i see it more as a character trait of theirs. But when someone who usually doesn't say stuff like this, suddenly uses sarcasm, it just throws me off guard and i get so confused. I don't understand why someone would be mean
I take breaks to avoid building a tolerance and just to...take a break. When I'm medicated, I feel compelled to be doing something all day. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing (it gets chores done), but it's exhausting to try and keep up with that every day.

On my days off I just consume more caffeine (usually tea since it's pretty mellow) to ward off the chaos a bit without going full tilt action mode. Then I can just relax and enjoy my hobbies.

I've heard about people "building a tolerance" but have never felt that to be true.

I've been taking my meds without fail since I was a young kid, minus a two year break where I didn't have insurance.

It's never been less effective imo. I'm still as driven and motivated as I was day 1.

It's not necessarily that you build a tolerance. I find that if I take it for too long my quality of sleep is affected and then the med loses it's effectiveness because it's fighting sleep deprivation.

My first semester in college I needed to take pre-calculus because it was required for my major. At that point I hadn't done any real math in 4+ years having just gotten out of the Marines. The professor gives his introduction and starts writing some crazy shit on the board, and says this. "This is the first day for most of you, so I'll start off with something easy."

I just sat there and thought to myself "I've never seen this before in my fucking life."

Ending up passing with a C-, and I was stoked.

Its getting even more worse when you dont have to solve the equation but prove that what you came up with is right.

and then at some point they abandon numbers and tangible concepts completely and just go with logic and ands and nands and xors and badabing badaboom you fail Math 1, "study" for 11 semesters, drop out and learn the job you originally wanted to pursue in a vocational school.

I don't think this is generally true. It's more similar to a muscle falling out of use and more advanced math tends to use different "muscles" (brain stuff) than basic math. When we first learn it we practice it daily for a long time, and we get strong at division, but we just aren't efficient enough to keep up with computers when doing complex computation so we stop using the muscle for long division and it gets weak.

We can always get it back! We just have to use it again, which is a lot harder than typing a few characters into a calculator.

This is exactly what happened to me. 5 years after graduating from college, I went back for a different degree that had some advanced math courses later on in the program.

I did some digging and found out that my local community college offered a math refresher course that was specifically designed for people who were out of practice with their math and just needed a quick 2-month refresher to get you back up to speed for more advanced math later.

It started from the very beginning with basic edition, subtraction, multiplication, division, then went through algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calc, and then calc. The very first day of the course I sat down and was looking at the basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and couldn't believe that I had forgotten how to do them. Within a few minutes I was back up and running but for a second I was flabbergasted at how much math knowledge I had lost by not doing stuff like that for years and years.

idk what partial differentiation
It's just differentiation, except your function has more than one variable (i.e. f(x,y) instead of f(x)) and you're effectively treating the other variable as if it was a constant. It uses this funny letter: ‚àÇ

The differentiation process itself is pretty simple, the complicated part comes with making use of the partial derivative(s).

In grade 4, we do long division, which seems much more complex than the math we did in high school.
What kind of shit math do they teach in the states?

In Australia, we have to do long division on polynomials.

I'm an engineer and I never, ever do math in my head.

A: Any time you rely on human cognition you're accepting an error rate.

B: You don't need to prove that you know it if you're actively applying it.

In highschool you're learning to do stuff with division so if you don't know the concept of division it'll be apparently almost immediately because you won't know why or how to apply it.

When I was in college I always made it a point to run all of my calculations through my ti-89 so it was always right and I could easily track/go back in my calculations. The material was hard enough, why risk the points on vanity?

Knowing how to do arithmetic is good for estimating stuff in day to day life. You can roughly guess how much a quarter of something is to make a quick shopping decision for example. But if you want the exact answer, you're totally right. Pointless to work it out by hand.

Because the math in 4th grade is simple and quick enough you can manually calculate it. In high school its complicated enough that it makes no sense to calculate it manually.

Plus school is literally all about learning how to learn. Its less about what you actually learn. You might not need what you learned earlier but you will need the method by which you learned to learn more complicated stuff - thats both in high school and more importantly: in you adult life.

I've always been bad at math, but I legit don't even remember how to do 4th grade math anymore.

Those long divisions in the image? Yeah, I can't do it anymore. I completely forgot how they work.

Just recently I took a general test (job search related), and during the math portion, I tried to do division like that and just couldn't figure it out.

Heck, even those simple number sequences are pushing the limits of what I can do if they start including division or multiplication.

After a few tries I got it all to come back and was fine but it's amazing how you don't even realize how much knowledge you're losing by not practicing it

I think grade school heavily gamifies things while the concepts are also still super simple. Your workload and pressure to complete it is also less. High school introduces a higher degree of complexity with greater weight on success or failure. Also just life: more shit is happening and pressure from a future graduation in only a few years (or less.) That much more shit floating around in the noggin is taking up more of that thinkin-space.

Because doing long division takes time. No matter your education level unless you spent a lot of your personal free time learning how to do it mentally, a long division problem will take you one or two minutes. I am in college, and in some of my classes a single problem could have dozens of individual math operations. It makes no sense to do it by hand, as I am not being tested on how well I understand division. Even though O conceptually understand it better than i did in 4th grade, it just isn‚Äôt useful to prove I know division when I‚Äôm doing solid mechanics.

RULES

1
Rule 1 - ALL POSTS MUST BE MEMES and FOLLOW A GENERAL MEME FORMAT
All posts must follow typical meme setup/design: an image/gif/video with some sort of caption; mods have final say on what is (not) a meme; tldr:

No titles as meme captions
A GIF/video alone (without caption) is not a meme [especially screen recording / scrolling]
Do not post screenshots of people saying something funny on Twitter/Tumblr/Reddit/TikTok/text messages
No unedited webcomics
No text-only memes
No IRL recreations or creepshots; no selfies or making friends into a meme
2
Rule 2 - NO MEMES ABOUT POLARIZING/POLITICAL TOPICS, VULNERABLE GROUPS, VIOLENCE, ETC. [SEE LIST]
No violation of Reddit Content Policy/TOS
No memes involving race, ethnicity, color, nationality, gender, sexual orientation/identity, religion, disability, etc. (can have a character, but that part cannot be integral)
No mention of gore, murder, suicide, death, terrorism, shootings, war, tragedies, sexual harassment/assault, pedophilia (even implied), incest, etc.
No politics/political topics/agendas; absurd memes featuring politicians are allowed if said status is merely incidental
3
Rule 3 - NO SPAM/CHAINPOSTING and NO OVERUSED/PROHIBITED MEME TEMPLATES [SEE LIST]
List of overused/prohibited meme types/templates READ THE LIST (monthly)
Reaction Memes are not allowed. Do not post a top/bottom image onto a screenshot, headline, comic, meme, or other content. See guide.
No split/linked posts (either between yourself or others), no chainposting. Do not flood the sub
NSFW posts must be marked; the central focus of the meme cannot be porn
Do not post over 5 times per 24 hrs
4
Rule 4 - NO INTERACTION-BAITING POSTS/TITLES and NO IDENTIFYING INFO/WATERMARKS
No usernames (other than your Reddit u/); do not show/link any social media/self-promote
Other than soft identifiers like mematic, no watermarks (iFunny is not allowed)
Do not post/request identifying info.
No posts relying on audience interaction (karma farms); examples: petitions, AMAs, "Comment X and I'll do Y", "wrong answers only", guessing/writing/rating songs, etc. [rhetorical questions may be OK, subject to mod judgment]
No mention of votes/cake days/karma/followers, etc.
5
Rule 5 - NO VIDEOS LONGER THAN 15 SECONDS and DIRECT REDDIT UPLOADS ONLY (NO LINKS)
Upload directly to Reddit; do not link to hosting sites like imgur
No videos longer than 15 seconds (and must include captions/meme text overlay)
No intentionally loud audio
Videos should not be TikToks or other non-meme content: Not every image/gif/video is a meme. This is what r/pics, r/gifs, or r/videos are for. Even if an image is comedic, it still may not be a meme if it's missing a caption/commentary
Gifs (w/ captions) are always allowed, as long as they don't violate other rules
6
Rule 6 - ONLY POST MEMES YOU ACTUALLY MADE YOURSELF/NO REPOSTS and NO BAD CROPPING/LOW-RES MEMES
If you found a meme somewhere else, do not post it here
If you want to post across other sites/subs, post to r/memes first. We will not look into your Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc. to verify the creator
Do not repost your same meme again later. Even mentioning the word "repost" is grounds for removal
Mods have discretion to remove posts which are poorly cropped (inc. aspect ratio), low resolution, grainy, artifacted, or pixelated. The mod team doesn't have to prove it is a repost
